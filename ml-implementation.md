# ML Implementation

## About SW development
the reason I am studying SW development is because IT has huge potentials and it can contribute hugely to people's life. Websites & Apps give people static values, smart phones & PC give the platform, ML gives more variety and customization to these.
 But since it's main focus is personalization(setting goal values and getting the best result), the goal should be clear. Also there need to be a clear understanding what features we are going to select.
