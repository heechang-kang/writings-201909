# opinion Tests

## movie Republica

 I watched a movei called 'Republica'. What did I feel about this movie?

how opinions are shaped
- remember the feeling**, the movie and the triggered feelings
  - strong emotion doesn't mean it was the most important thing.
- find the reason why I felt that emotion -> 
- good opinion goes to the direction that lasts long but also has impact on the present
