Q&A

\# Why do we need value creation tool?  
When living a life, we tend to form our characteristics and that is very unique
and when appreciated by others, we can have a job and earn money. But it is very
difficult to form those characteristics with strong logical correlation and also
that aligns with the society and others. We have to be blamed and criticized and
then be able to amend our possibilities.

\# In what kind of structure is the value creation tool in?  
Firstly see how others build their logic and their characteristics. Then try to
visualize or make it as a chatbot to make it as a strong formation but not one
sided.  
Try to implement a streamline.

\# what do I have to study now(in CS field)?  
the goal of understanding CS is the strong logical foundation and the
implementation and also the impact it can give to the society. Focusing on this
point, building a website or a platform to collect data is important. Also with
this data we should be able to form a pipeline.

Goal : value creation platform

-   Inspect

    See how people see and determine the value and how they are created.

    Using data, try to find out the important parameters.

-   Create

    After understanding how the values are created and have my own theory for
    that, try to create and display my values using the draft version of the
    platform.

-   When it is thought that the value creation process can be used globally, try
    to make others to use them. Maximize the benefit and broaden the area it
    covers.

-   Educate

    Try to display the useful information for people to create their values.

Project using data science

Data science pipeline  
the purpose of a data science project : make a prediction, find an insight
through meaningful data,  
So when doing a data science project we first have define the problem
specifically after understanding the overall environment like a business man.
Then we collect data that are related to

\*a thing that I miss and lack of : when understanding the overall environment,
it is very difficult for an individual to understand all the parameters. A
personâ€™s view is always limited to some point so try to ask opinions to others
about the situation.

Project : how can we create and stack our values more efficiently?
