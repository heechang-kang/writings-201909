 need to start building a project that tells about myself and help enhance my ability to develop SW products.

skill sets I have to use
- data science : data and ML config & deployment
- web dev
- API designing
- cloud

## purpose of this project
people create values and understand the world by exploring and setting their mindset. Some live just for short-term happiness or long-term and every person has different weights on their values.

But their are elements, nodes that help shape stable, long-term, short-term happiness in our life. This could be learned from buddhist philosophy. So from buddhism philosophy, try to understand the philosophy and then find elements that are important.(content is crucial)

psychology -> social sicence -> books: novel, philosophy, poet -> ...

## contents
1. help exploration : podcast + text + image with expert\
    whole system is meant to build a NN that is customized for the user but not just limited to a simple parameter, should be able to expand but ber focused; also try to divide oneself depending on the time-span or the condition
2. help creation : \
   when people keep exploring they are also being able to create something on their own which means if there is a sufficient tool for them, they can enhance their value or explore new things in a new and effiecient way.(i think that's why YOUTUBE became a popular platform and expanding in a very fast way)
3. make contents : try to make contents that i am capable of creating
