# creation

 need to start building a project that tells about myself and help enhance my ability to develop SW products.

skill sets I have to use
- data science : data and ML config & deployment
- web dev
- API designing

## GOAL
### 2019-09
 - I need to see that human's emotional state is headed in similar direction.
 - I need to find a way to enhance this activity by leading and showing them.
 - try to make a content based on politics & personal

## purpose of this project
people create values and understand the world by exploring and setting their mindset. Some live just for short-term happiness or long-term and every person has different weights on their values.

But their are elements, nodes that help shape stable, long-term, short-term happiness in our life. This could be learned from buddhist philosophy. So from buddhism philosophy, try to understand the philosophy and then find elements that are important.(content is crucial)

psychology -> social sicence -> books: novel, philosophy, poet -> ...

## contents
1. help exploration : podcast + text + image with expert\
    whole system is meant to build a NN that is customized for the user but not just limited to a simple parameter, should be able to expand but ber focused; also try to divide oneself depending on the time-span or the condition
2. help creation :
   when people keep exploring they are also being able to create something on their own which means if there is a sufficient tool for them, they can enhance their value or explore new things in a new and effiecient way.(i think that's why YOUTUBE became a popular platform and expanding in a very fast way)
3. make contents : \
   try to make contents that i am capable of creating

## creation pipeline
- make a website introducing myself and try to design it \
- build a recommendation system regarding the contents around the world : try to extract the right element using them
- make a content that looks ideal


## Q&A
- how can I get employed? will the doing project not enough?
   try to look into LINKEDIN, GLASSDOOR etc more often and try to see the required skills and try to preactice them by implementing the things in my project.

- what additional thing should I put focus on my project?
  deeply understanding the people. Reading the opinions sections of bloomberg, WSJ, NYtimes is important but also being able to write a paper and present is important when making a contents of my project idea.
