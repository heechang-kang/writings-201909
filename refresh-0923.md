# Balancing

I consider freedom to think is the important value to myself. But not just limited to just my happiness i want to understand the long-term happiness that will bring to me. Based on this kind of thoughts I try to study very broad things and try to make a single but that diverges./
For example like creating a platform where people create their values and explore and be able to learn from this platform. Try to make this platform but at first try to understand the process and technology needed.\
